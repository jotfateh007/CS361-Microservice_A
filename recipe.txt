## Tres Leches Flan

This recipe combines the classic, creamy goodness of flan with the decadent, tres leches (three milks) soaking that makes it incredibly sweet and luscious.

**Yields:** 6 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 45-60 minutes


**Ingredients:**

**For the Flan:**

* 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 1 (14 ounce) can whole milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 4 large eggs
* 1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for extra richness)
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional, for a warm, spiced touch)
* 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder (optional, for a chocolatey twist)

**For the Tres Leches Soak:**

* 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
* 1 (12 ounce) can whole milk
* 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 1/4 cup dark rum or tequila (optional)


**For the Topping (optional):**

* 1/4 cup chopped pecans or almonds
* 1/4 cup fresh or frozen raspberries or strawberries
* Unsweetened cocoa powder


**Instructions:**

**1. Prepare the Flan Custard:**

* Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour 6 ramekins (about 6 ounces each).
* Whisk together sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, vanilla extract, eggs, heavy cream (if using), cinnamon (if using), and cocoa powder (if using) in a bowl until well combined.
* Divide the custard mixture evenly among the prepared ramekins.
* Carefully place ramekins in a larger baking dish. Pour hot water into the larger baking dish until it comes about halfway up the sides of the ramekins. This creates a water bath.
* Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the flan is just set and the center is slightly jiggly.  The center shouldn't be completely firm.  The custard should move slightly when jiggled.
* Remove from oven and let cool completely in the water bath.
* Once cool, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flan to set completely.

**2. Prepare the Tres Leches Soak:**

* In a shallow dish, combine evaporated milk, whole milk, and sweetened condensed milk. Stir well.  If using alcohol, add to this mixture.

**3. Assemble the Flan:**

* Carefully invert each flan onto a plate.  This might take a little practice.  If the flan doesn't come out easily, run a thin knife around the edge of the ramekin first.
* Pour the Tres Leches soak over the top of each flan, allowing it to soak into the custard.


**4. Serve & Decorate:**

* Sprinkle with chopped nuts or fruit if desired.
* Dust with cocoa powder before serving.


**Notes:**

* The longer the flan chills, the better the flavors will meld.
* If you don't have ramekins, you can use a single, larger baking dish and make a single flan, slicing it later to serve.
* Feel free to adjust the sweetness levels of the custard based on your preference, by using less sweetened condensed milk in the custard mixture if desired.
* Use a whisk to thoroughly combine all the ingredients.
