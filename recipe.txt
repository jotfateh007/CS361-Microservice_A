## Spicy Sichuan Mapo Tofu

This recipe delivers a flavorful and spicy Sichuan-style dish perfect for a main course.

**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 20 minutes


**Ingredients:**

* **For the Tofu:**
    * 1 block (14 oz) extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed (pressing removes excess water for a firmer texture; pressing can be done by placing the block of tofu on a plate with a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes)
    * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* **For the Sauce:**
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 inch ginger, minced
    * 1 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced
    * 1/2 cup dried fermented black beans, rinsed and chopped (optional, but adds depth of flavor)
    * 2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns (or 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder)
    * 1 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper (or to taste, a pinch of fennel seeds)
    * 1 tablespoon Doubanjiang (fermented chili bean paste)  
    * 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce (adjust to your spice preference!)
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
    * 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium preferable)
    * 2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine (optional, adds depth of flavor)
    * 1/4 cup water
    * 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed well with 2 tablespoons water (slurry for thickening)
    * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil


* **To serve:**
    * 2 cups cooked rice for serving


**Equipment:**
* Wok or large skillet


**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Tofu:** Coat the tofu cubes with cornstarch.  Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry the tofu until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the remaining vegetable oil to the wok. Add the garlic and ginger, and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell pepper and Sichuan peppercorns, stir-fry for 1 minute more. If using, add the fermented black beans, and stir-fry for another minute, ensuring the beans are heated through.

3. **Bloom Spices:** Stir in the Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, and cumin.   Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. This is key to unlocking the flavor of the spices.

4. **Add the Sauce:** Stir in the Doubanjiang, chili garlic sauce.  Cook for 1 minute, constantly stirring. Be cautious, as this paste can quickly heat up. 

5. **Combine and Simmer:** Pour in the soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine (if using), and water. Bring to a simmer, stirring continuously.  Add the fried tofu back to the wok.

6. **Thicken the Sauce:** Whisk the cornstarch slurry together and slowly drizzle it into the sauce while stirring constantly.  The sauce will thicken as it cooks. If it gets too thick, add a little more water, a tablespoon at a time.  The sauce should have a nice thick consistency.  Add the optional cornstarch and continue to cook until glaze is set, and sauce is shiny.

7. **Serve:** Serve the Mapo Tofu hot over cooked rice.  Garnish with extra chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired.  


**Tips & Variations:**

* **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili garlic sauce to control the spice level.
* **Protein:** You can use other proteins such as beef, pork, or mushrooms in place of tofu. Adjust cooking time as needed.
* **Vegetables:**  Add other vegetables like bok choy or bamboo shoots for extra nutrients.
* **Fresh Chili Oil:** A drizzle of fresh chili oil on top adds a fantastic aroma and a spicy kick.
* **Peanut Sauce Variation:**  For a nutty twist try a peanut sauce. Cook it with the sauce at the end for a smoother more combined flavor.
