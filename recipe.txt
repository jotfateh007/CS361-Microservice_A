This recipe delivers a rich, savory, and spicy Mapo Tofu, a classic Sichuan dish.

**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 25 minutes


**Ingredients:**

* **For the Tofu:**
    * 1 block (14oz) extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed
    * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* **For the Sauce:**
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 1 tablespoon minced ginger
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 tablespoon fermented black beans (doubanjiang), adjust to taste
    * 1/2 tablespoon chili bean paste (doubanpao) or adjust to taste, more for extra heat
    * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    * 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    * 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar
    * 1/4 teaspoon sugar
    * 1/4 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, crushed
    * 1/4 cup Shaoxing rice wine (optional, but adds depth)
    * 1/4 cup water or broth (to thin sauce, as needed)

* **For Garnish:**
    * 1/4 cup chopped scallions (green onions)
    * 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds


**Equipment:**
* Large skillet or wok
* Plate for pressing tofu (optional, but recommended)

**Instructions:**

**1. Tofu Prep:**  Press the tofu to remove excess water. This is crucial for a good texture.  You can press it under a heavy object like a plate with a heavy book on top for 15-30 minutes.  Cut the pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes and toss with cornstarch to coat.

**2. Cook the Tofu:** Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until golden brown and lightly crispy on all sides (about 3-4 minutes per side). Remove the tofu from the skillet and set aside.

**3. Make the Sauce:** Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan and stir-fry the ginger and garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds).  Add the fermented black beans, chili bean paste, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar, and crushed Sichuan peppercorns.  Stir constantly for about 1 minute, allowing the flavors to combine.  If using, add the Shaoxing wine.

**4. Combine and Finish:** Add the cooked tofu back into the pan with the sauce. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the water or broth, a little at a time, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

**5. Serve:** Serve the Mapo Tofu immediately over rice, noodles, or with steamed buns. Garnish with chopped scallions and toasted sesame seeds.

**Tips & Variations:**

* **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili bean paste to control the spiciness.
* **Tofu Texture:** If you prefer a softer tofu, reduce the cooking time slightly.
* **Liquid:** If the sauce is too thick, add more water or broth, little by little, until desired consistency.
* **Meat:**  For a heartier dish, include some finely sliced pork or ground pork in the sauce.
* **Vegetables:** You can add in other vegetable like mushrooms, or sliced bell peppers to the sauce.
* **Serving Suggestions:** Mapo Tofu goes well with steamed rice, and steamed buns.
