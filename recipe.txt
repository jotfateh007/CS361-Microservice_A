    * 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
    * 2 tablespoons minced garlic
    * 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, crushed
    * 1 dried red chili/chilies (adjust to your spice preference), finely chopped (or 1 teaspoon chili flakes)
    * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    * 1/4 cup dark soy sauce
    * 2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine
    * 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
    * 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
* **For the Tofu:**
    * 1 block (14 oz) extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
    * 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms (shiitake or button) 


**Equipment:**
* Wok or large skillet
* Mixing bowl


**Instructions:**

**Get Started:**

1. **Press the Tofu:** Press the tofu to remove excess water. This is crucial for a good texture. You can wrap it in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and put a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes.

**Make the Sauce:**

2. **Prepare the Sauce Ingredients:** Finely chop all the sauce ingredients.  Crumble the douchi and finely chop the dried chili.

**Cook the Tofu:**

3. **Cook the Tofu:** Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pressed tofu cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crispy.  Set aside.

4. **Sauté Vegetables:** Add the vegetable oil to the same pan. Add the sliced green bell pepper and mushrooms. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, until slightly softened.

**Combine and Finish:**

5. **Make the Sauce:** Add the crushed Sichuan peppercorns, ginger, garlic, and chopped chili to the pan. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the fermented black beans and stir-fry for another minute.

6. **Simmer the Sauce:** Pour in the dark soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, honey/brown sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Stir well and bring to a simmer.

7. **Combine and Thicken:** Add in the cooked tofu and bell pepper/mushroom mixture. Stir to combine.  Mix in the cornstarch slurry by whisking the cornstarch into a little cold water before adding it to the pan to thicken the sauce.

8. **Simmer and Serve:**  Simmer until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency, stirring frequently.  Serve hot over steamed rice.

**Optional Garnishes:**


* Chopped scallions
* Sesame seeds


**Tips and Variations:**

* **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili to control the spice level.
* **Tofu Variety:**  You can use firm tofu, but extra-firm tofu will hold its shape better.
* **Vegetables:** Feel free to add other vegetables like shredded carrots or bamboo shoots.
* **Meat Variation:** For a more substantial dish, add some thinly sliced beef or pork to the mixture along with the tofu and vegetables.
* **Cornstarch:** Use a slurry for a smoother sauce.
