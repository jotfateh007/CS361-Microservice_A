4. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally, and allowing the flavors to meld. For a richer stew, increase cooking time to 3 hours.


5. **Adjust Seasoning:** Taste the stew and adjust seasoning as needed. You might want more salt, pepper, paprika, caraway, or sugar.
6. **Serve:** Serve hot, optionally with crusty bread for soaking up the delicious juices.

* **Spice it up:** Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce if desired.
* **Using different cuts of meat:**  You can use different cuts of pork or add other meats, like beef, or more sausages.
* **Making it vegetarian:** omit the meat and add more vegetables for a hearty vegetarian Bigos.
