**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 25 minutes


**Ingredients:**

* **For the Tofu:**
    * 1 block (14 oz) extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed
    * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* **For the Sauce:**
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 1 tablespoon minced ginger
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1/2 cup finely chopped Sichuan peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp crushed Sichuan peppercorns)
    * 1/4 cup fermented black beans, rinsed and drained
    * 1/4 cup diced Napa cabbage
    * 1/2 cup finely sliced scallions
    * 1/2 cup water or vegetable broth
    * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    * 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry)
    * 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water (for slurry)
    * 1-2 tablespoons chili oil (adjust to your spice preference)
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns
    * 1 teaspoon sugar (adjust for taste)
    * 1 tablespoon minced dried chili peppers for spice (optional for extra heat, increase as desired)

**Equipment**
* Large skillet or wok


**Instructions**


1. **Press the Tofu:** Pressing the tofu removes excess water, making it firmer and preventing a soggy dish.  Press the tofu for at least 15 minutes (or longer for more substantial results) using a plate and heavy object. Cut the pressed tofu into bite-sized cubes.

2. **Cook the Tofu:** Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until golden brown and slightly crispy on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.


3. **Make the Sauce:** Add the vegetable oil to the same pan and heat over medium heat. Add the ginger, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.  Add the fermented black beans and Napa cabbage and sauté for another 2 minutes.

4. **Build the Sauce:** Stir in the water or broth, soy sauce, rice wine (or sherry), chili oil, ground Sichuan peppercorns, dried chili peppers (if using) and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently.

5. **Thicken the Sauce:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1-2 minutes.

6. **Combine and Serve:** Add the cooked tofu back to the pan. Toss everything together until the tofu is coated in the sauce. Stir in the scallions and cook for another minute to wilt gently.


7. **Serve:** Serve immediately over rice or noodles. Garnish with extra chopped scallions, if desired.


**Tips and Variations:**

* **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of chili oil and dried chili peppers to your preference.
* **Meat:**  You can add ground pork or beef to the sauce for a more substantial dish.
* **Vegetables:** Feel free to add other vegetables, such as shredded carrots or mushrooms.
* **Peanut Oil:** For additional flavor, substitute peanut oil for vegetable oil.
* **Dried Chili Paste:**  add a spoonful or two of a good quality dried chili sauce for a different flavor than just the chili oil.
